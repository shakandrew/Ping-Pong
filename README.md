# Ping-Pong
[PAIN] WinApi project
This project consists from 2 various applications. Each part presents one half of the ping-pong table. 

[HoToRun] You can just run 2 .exe files from exe folder only if you are using Windows, if you are Linux user, so, u have sources, and gool luck :D. 
Notice: You can't start game running only 1 application. Game starts when you click on the right part of the "table". You control right application using
buttons up and down, and left part using mouse.

[HoToBuild] You have 2 files in each folder(Ping-Pong 1 and Ping-Pong 2). If you want to build this project, you need to create new win32 application in VS (it will include
all the libraries you need).
Note: There is no lometric but you want it, so you should add it :D
